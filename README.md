Star Wing is a 3D spaceship shooter built with Three.js for web browsers. The player controls a lone starfighter pilot in a game that blends classic arcade shooter action with roguelike progression with a retro pixel-art aesthetic combined with neon cyberpunk effects and a synth-heavy soundtrack that creates a stylized sci-fi atmosphere.
